# LINKEDAGENT - AI POWERED RESUME MAKER AND JOB APPLIER 


## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **agentic AI** to automate and optimize the job application pipeline. It supports users through two major components:

1. **ATS-Friendly Resume Generation**
2. **Automated LinkedIn Job Application Engine**

By intelligently integrating user data, LLMs, and real-time job scraping, this system aims to **minimize manual effort**, **enhance resume targeting**, and **maximize job match accuracy**â€”all while increasing the likelihood of securing interviews.
